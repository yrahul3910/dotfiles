# Keybindings

Here are the most important keybindings. Some come from Kickstart, but most are custom.

* `<C-\>` opens a floating terminal window. You can use `<number><C-\>` to open a different one. When the floating window is open, you can be in insert or normal mode; in insert mode, `Esc` will hide the window. In normal mode, use `<C-\>` again.
* `<C-]>` goes to definition, including going inside libraries.
* `V` selects the current line in visual mode. You can then move the selected lines using `J` and `K`.
* Generally, `j` goes UP and `k` goes DOWN. I prefer it this way.
* Finding uses the following keymaps (all preceded by a space, which is the leader key):
  * Space finds open file names.
  * `/` searches in the current buffer.
  * `fb` finds across open buffers.
  * `fg` finds across all files (except those in gitignore).
  * `ff` searches file names (except those in gitignore).
  * `fh` searches the help sections.
  * `fr` resumes the previous search.
  * `f/` searches in open buffers.
* `<leader>a` toggles the Aerial window (which shows a list of classes, functions, etc.)
* `<leader>d` and `<leader>c` are mapped to `"_d` and `"_c`. This makes sure it doesn't overwrite your clipboard when you delete or change text.
* `<leader>o` creates a new blank line below the current one, without leaving normal mode.
* `<leader>bc` closes the current buffer.
* For testing, the following exist (preceded by the leader key):
  * `tr` runs the nearest test.
  * `tf` runs all tests in the current file.
  * `to` shows the test output.
* `<leader>xc` makes the file executable.methods 
* Generally, the prefix `<leader>p` is used for plugin actions.
* As an example, `<leader>ph` leads to Harpoon2 keybindings. After this prefix, `a` adds the current file, `d` deletes the current file, and `o` opens the list of files in Telescope.
* `<leader>pt` leads to Trouble keybindings. Use `t` to toggle the window and `f` to fix.
* `<leader>cl` changes the colorscheme to light. Of course, `<leader>cd` changes to dark.
* `<leader>xc` makes the current file executable.
* `<leader>fm` formats the current buffer (or at least, attempts to).
* `<leader>yc` yanks to clipboard.
* `K` previews declaration, so I mapped `<leader>kf` to peek at definition, using `nvim-treesitter-textobjects`. Use the keybinding twice to enter the peek window. There's also the less useful `<leader>kF`.
* `<C-n>` toggles treesitter. Use `<leader>pr` to refresh it.
* `gh` goes to the beginning of the first word in the current line (same as `_`). `gl` goes to the end of the line (the same as `$`). `ge` goes to the end of the file. These were inspired by Helix.
* `<leader>pha` adds the current file to Harpoon. `<leader>phd` removes it, and `<leader>pho` shows the Harpoon window
* `<C-v>`, `<C-b>`, `<C-n>`, `<C-m>` switch between Harpoon buffers.
